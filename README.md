# GEN-AI-WORKSHOPP
Day-2

This work showcases foundational image processing techniques using Python's OpenCV library. It begins by setting up the environment with essential packages like NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib. An image (sample.jpeg) is loaded and resized for consistent processing. The color format is converted from OpenCV's default BGR to RGB for accurate visualization using Matplotlib.
It begins with loading and resizing an image, then converting it from BGR to RGB for accurate display. Key transformations include grayscale and HSV conversions, as well as geometric operations like flipping and rotating the image. A Gaussian Blur is applied to reduce noise and smooth the image. These techniques are essential for tasks such as preprocessing in computer vision, data augmentation, and feature extraction. The notebook provides a strong foundation for beginners aiming to build projects in areas like AI, object detection, and medical image analysis.
